#cert-keypair =         File holding the RSA keypair for signing this certificate, in pem format.
#cert-keypair-pwd =     Passphrase for the keypair file, in txt format.
#                       For enhanced security, this parameter can be omitted, and then the utility will prompt for direct TTY input.
#soc-id =               Binary file holding the 16byte SOC_ID.
#debug-mask =           The DCU mask requested by the developer. 31bit mask in hex format (e.g. 0x7000000f).
#                       if rma-mode in the Primary Debug certificate is defined, this is only dummy and the value will be ignored by the ROM code.
#prim-dbg-cert-pkg =    The Primary Debug certificate package. 
#cert-pkg =             Final certificate package (Primary+Secondary) output file. Binary format.
